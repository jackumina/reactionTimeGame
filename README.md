# reactionTimeGame
This is a game that test your reaction time (how quick you can hit the space bar). This is a stateful 'CRUD' (create - POST, read - GET, update - PUT, delete - DELETE) game that gives me practice with restful API's.

This repo holds two projects, both run a reactionTimerGame. 
- usingJS- folder holds the game implemented with node.js as the API and NeDB for the database with normal html, css, and javascript files to run the client side code.
- usingReact- folder holds the game to implemented with node.js as the API, NeDB ...?, and React.js for the client side code.
