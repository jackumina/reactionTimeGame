# reactionTimeGame

This is a game that test your reaction time (how quick you can hit the space bar). This is a stateful 'CRUD' (create - POST, read - GET, update - PUT, delete - DELETE) game that gives me practice with restful API's. I am using node.js for the API and I am using NeDB as the database for this project.

How to run:
  - Download this repo
  - Go to the folder in terminal and type 'npm install' to download all the dependecies of this project
  - Then type 'node index.js', the port number will appear on the next line
  - Go to localhost:{port number}
