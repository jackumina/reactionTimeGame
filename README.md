# reactionTimeGame
This is a game that test your reaction time (how quick you can hit the space bar). This is a stateful 'CRUD' (create - POST, read - GET, update - PUT, delete - DELETE) game that gives me practice with restful API's.

This repo holds two projects, both run a reactionTimerGame. 
- The usingJS folder holds the game implemented with node.js as the API and NeDB for the database with normal html, css, and javascript files to run the client side code.
- the usingReact folder holds the game to implemented with node.js as the API, NeDB ...?, and React.js for the client side code.

How to run:
  - Download this repo
  - Navigate to the usingJS or usingReact folder in the terminal
  - Type 'npm install' to download all the dependecies of this project
  - Then type 'node index.js', the port number will appear on the next line
  - Go to localhost:{port number}
